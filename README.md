pair-select
===========

A jQuery plugin for communication between two HTML select boxes. 


What does it do?
----------------

You have two select/multiselect boxes. After selecting some values from one box, if you click a add button, you want the selected elements to be moved from selectbox 1 to selectbox 2.
Now if you select some values and click on remove button, the vice versa will take place.


What's different?
-----------------
Normally, it's easy to remove an option from select box 1 and add it to select box 2. But when you want to remove it from select box 2 and want it to be place right at the place where it was there in the select box 1, then it become a little hard.
And sorting is not a solution all the time.

So, **Pair Select** gives you the power to do that with very minimal lines of code.
